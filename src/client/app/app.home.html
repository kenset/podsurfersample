          <h1>Hello!</h1>
          <p>Welcome to the PodSurfer Sample App.</p>
          <p>This app exists to show you how Angular controllers, factories, 
            templates, and other Angular files work together to call an endpoint and display data on the screen.</p>
          <p>It was made with the 
            <a href="https://github.com/johnpapa/generator-hottowel" target="_blank">Angular HotTowel Generator</a> 
            by 
            <a href="https://twitter.com/john_papa" target="_blank">John Papa</a>, 
            and follows his

            .</p>
          <p>The files shown here are sufficient for understanding the path we take to get a piece of data, 
            but it's not the whole picture. Like most code snippets, there are other pieces in play that make 
            the whole thing work. If you're interested in seeing how this app is structured, or how the 'logger' works, 
            or anything else, check out the repo for this project on
